- add a "optimistic" feature for setting deploy group. This requires rsync 3.1.0+ locally & on the remote. A warning is logged but doesn't abort.
- add a `run_local` method to Remote to wrap `Shell.run_local` to display commands when in verbose mode.

# 1.2.3
- fix bug in manifest creation/saving from changes in ruby 2.2.x

# 1.2.2
- bump dependency of `HereOrThere`, prevents issues w/ getting the contents of remote files when they're large enough to have chunked responses.

# 1.2.1
- fix bug where `Strategy::Branches` wasn't caching manifests, causing the prune task to fail at removing releases from the manifest.

# 1.2.0
- remote specific config is now tied directly to the remote through it's own config object. Internally this cleans up many checks, but causes [BREAKING] changes if you depended on the API of any of the internal classes. If you use config data in any of your tasks, it's now suggested that you do so inside your `remotes` iterators.
- get `Strategy::Branches` supporting multiple remotes. The stdout output of `list_releases` and `prune_releases` has changed, so if you depended on this it may be breaking.
- move `Strategy::Branches` custom behavior to a `post_deploy_task` so it uses the same `deploy` method inherited from `Strategy::Base`. This could cause [BREAKING] changes if you use a custom `post_deploy_task` with a `Branches` deploy type.

# 1.1.0
- `#persisted_releaser` is available on a deployment from rake tasks. this will be the same for tasks called during a deploy for example.
- addition of a `#current_release_data` method for the Revisions releaser. This pulls merged data from the manifest and the log file.
- add `log_file_path` and `log_file_entry` to config to setup a log file for all deploys
- [BREAKING] change interface of releasers to expect being able to pass a second argument (build data) to #create_release
- add task hook for before the symlink in the Revisions releaser. `pre_symlink_task` gets called with |releaser, remote| in a remote loop so it's run for each.
- add ability to create user rake tasks that have access to deployment information. see [the docs](doc/config/task-definitions.md) for more info

# 1.0.2
- make sure that Revisions#remove_untracked_revisions checks it against the "current" revision before removing it.

# 1.0.1

- create `Branches::Index` and render erb for the template
- move Branches specific ideas into the Branches namespace
- add `Deployment::Manifest#put` method to update manifest data for matching records
- remove `Statistrano::Deployment::Manifest` & `Statistrano::Deployment::Manifest::RemoteStore` in favor of using the same manifest as the Revisions releaser
- add option for rsync flags [b5a248be8d96d142ca94c076d80ad6deaa0fa69e]
- loosen rainbows dependency to work with old & new bananabin
- reorganize deployment types & releasers. now use a single remote object, and different "strategies" for base, releases, & branches and different "releasers" for single or revisions
- remote multi_target in favor of merging code paths w/ strategies & releasers
- can now access deployment info directly in build_tasks & post_deploy_tasks by giving arity [de05bb3a7d760fc51571b0f93f457065758fa772]
- rake tasks no manually registered (instead of on initialization) [ac72eb0a65681e472b21c486fa67f7f0dd635c02]
- add explicit setting for file & directory permissions on deploy [25ed930235e348fd6068cedbdc09b33e788fc3d5]
